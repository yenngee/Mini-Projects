# Mini-Projects
This repo will contain all mini and simple projects 


## mini: Team-Fifa 
#### Note (25-Aug-18): 
- Worked together with 3 other classmates from GA over about 5-6 hours. 
- Presentation in the same folder with same name
- Learning points: 
  1) we took a long time to decide on the metric to determine how exciting a game is. 
  2) In our presentation we could have added one more slide that states the conclusion 
  3) The graph where we wanted to state an inverse relationship between the 'exciting games' and advertisment costs can be clearer 

#### Question: 
You are working for an advertising analytics consulting company. Your client, a name brand television network, needs to re-formulate their pricing structure for advertisement slots during soccer matches for new customers. They also want this new structure to incentivize existing customers to create new partnerships/sponsors with teams and players.

1) Determine a reasonable metric to decide how exciting a game is. Engineer this feature using existing data.
2) Suggest a pricing structure tied to the overall value associated with "game excitement".



## mini: Discriminatory pricing 
#### Note (25-Aug-18): 
- Worked together with 2 other classmates from GA over about 6-8 hours. 
- Presentation in the same folder with same name
- Learning points: 
  1) A long time was taken trying to agree on trying to analyze whether or not the different features truely affect the price. In hindsight, instead of selecting features at the start, we could have included all the features and do feature selection/elimination using various methods 
  2) In our presentation, we could be more careful when saying "Reject null hypothesis, BK practice price discrimination due to income" Instead we could have sait "Reject null hypothesis, the difference between the mean of the two groups is statistically different"

#### Question: 
The goal of this exercise is to evaluate whether or not fast food restaurants are using discriminatory pricing. This is a fairly open-ended prompt. It's up to you to determine how to quantify pricing discrimination using the following groups of variables:

The price of fast food items, which can be a metric of discriminatory practices.
The proportion of African Americans residents, low-income residents, and residents without a car.
